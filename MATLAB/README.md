# MATLAB

Use this template to deploy transformations that use MATLAB and Simulink. 

## Requirements

To compile MATLAB and Simulink to .NET, you need the following MathWorks products
 - MATLAB
 - MATLAB Compiler
 - MATLAB Compiler SDK 

To create Python packages from Simulink products, in addition to the above list, you also need
 - Simulink
 - Simulink Compiler

## Environment variables
 - `input`: Kafka topic to receive input data from.
 - `output`: Kafka topic to write the results of the transformation.

## Preparing .NET assemblies from MATLAB and Simulink

`MATLAB` directory in the project has pre-compiled assemblies from MATLAB and Simulink assets. So, you can simply deploy and run this project. However, if you'd like to compile the .NET assemblies from source files, you can find them in the `assets` directory of this project. You can compile them using the following command:

```
mcc -W 'dotnet:quixmatlab,api=matlab-data,framework_version=6.0' rot.m engine.m -d ../MATLAB
```

You only need the `*.ctf` file in the `MATLAB` directory in this template. Please refer to MATLAB Compiler SDK documentation listed below for available compiler flags.

Following example from MathWorks has useful information on preparing a Simulink model for deployment. The project shows how to package and call the model from Python. However, the design principles of the model is equally applicable to .NET.
