%
% This example shows how to model a four-cylinder spark ignition internal
% combustion engine from the throttle to the crankshaft output. We used
% well-defined physical principles supplemented, where appropriate, with
% empirical relationships that describe the system's dynamic behavior
% without introducing unnecessary complexity.

%% Analysis and Physics
%
% This example describes the concepts and details surrounding the creation
% of engine models with emphasis on important Simulink(R) modeling
% techniques.  The basic model uses the enhanced capabilities of Simulink
% to capture time-based events with high fidelity. Within this simulation,
% a triggered subsystem models the transfer of the air-fuel mixture from
% the intake manifold to the cylinders via discrete valve events. This
% takes place concurrently with the continuous-time processes of intake
% flow, torque generation and acceleration. A second model adds an
% additional triggered subsystem that provides closed-loop engine speed
% control via a throttle actuator. These models can be used as standalone
% engine simulations. Or, they can be used within a larger system model,
% such as an integrated vehicle and powertrain simulation, in the
% development of a traction control system.
%
% This model is based on published results by Crossley and Cook (1991).  It
% describes the simulation of a four-cylinder spark ignition internal
% combustion engine. The Crossley and Cook work also shows how a simulation
% based on this model was validated against dynamometer test data. The
% ensuing sections (listed below) analyze the key elements of the engine
% model that were identified by Crossley and Cook:
%
% # Throttle
% # Intake manifold
% # Mass flow rate
% # Compression stroke
% # Torque generation and acceleration
%
% * Note: Additional components can be added to the model to provide
% greater accuracy in simulation and to more closely replicate the behavior
% of the system.
% 

%% Throttle
%
% The first element of the model is the throttle body. The control input is
% the angle of the throttle plate. The rate at which the model introduces
% air into the intake manifold can be expressed as the product of two
% functions:
%
% # an empirical function of the throttle plate angle only
% # a function of the atmospheric and manifold pressures 
%
% In cases of lower manifold pressure (greater vacuum), the flow rate
% through the throttle body is sonic and is only a function of the throttle
% angle. This model accounts for this low pressure behavior with a
% switching condition in the compressibility equations shown in Equation 1.

%% 
% *Equation 1*
%
% $$\dot{m}_{ai} = f(\theta)\cdot g(P_m) = \mbox{mass flow rate into manifold (g/s)}$$
%
% $$f(\theta) = 2.821 - 0.05231\cdot\theta + 0.10299\cdot\theta^2 - 0.00063\cdot\theta^3$$
%
% $$g(P_m) = 1; \mbox{ if } P_m \le P_{amb}/2 $$
%
% $$g(P_m) = \frac{2}{P_{amb}} \sqrt{P_mP_{amb} - P^2_m}; \mbox{ if } P_{amb}/2 \le P_m \le P_{amb} $$
% 
% $$g(P_m) = -\frac{2}{P_m} \sqrt{P_m P_{amb} - P^2_{amb}}; \mbox{ if } P_{amb} \le P_m \le 2P_{amb} $$
%
% $$g(P_m) = -1; \mbox{ if } P_m \ge 2P_{amb} $$
%
% $$\dot{m}_{ai} \rightarrow \mbox{mass flow rate into manifold (g/s); } $$
%
% $$ \theta \rightarrow \mbox{throttle angle (deg);}$$
%
% $$ P_m \rightarrow \mbox{manifold pressure (bar); } $$
%
% $$P_{amb} \rightarrow \mbox{ambient (atmospheric) pressure (bar);}$$

%% Intake Manifold
%
% The simulation models the intake manifold as a differential equation for
% the manifold pressure. The difference in the incoming and outgoing mass
% flow rates represents the net rate of change of air mass with respect to
% time. This quantity, according to the ideal gas law, is proportional to
% the time derivative of the manifold pressure (see Equation 2). Note that,
% unlike the model of Crossley and Cook (see also references 3 through 5),
% this model doesn't incorporate exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), although
% this can easily be added.

%%
% *Equation 2*
%
% $$\dot{P}_m = \frac{RT}{V_m}\left( \dot{m}_{ai} - \dot{m}_{ao} \right)$$
%
% $$
% R \rightarrow \mbox{specific gas constant; } 
% $$
%
% $$
% T \rightarrow \mbox{temperature (K); }
% $$ 
%
% $$
% V_m \rightarrow \mbox{manifold volume } (m^3) \mbox{; }
% $$
%
% $$
% \dot{m}_{ao} \rightarrow \mbox{mass flow rate of air out of the manifold (g/s); }
% $$
%
% $$
% \dot{P}_m \rightarrow \mbox{rate of change of manifold pressure (bar/s);}
% $$

%% Intake Mass Flow Rate
%
% The mass flow rate of air that the model pumps into the cylinders from
% the manifold is described in Equation 3 by an empirically derived
% equation. This mass rate is a function of the manifold pressure and the
% engine speed.

%%
% *Equation 3*
%
% $$
% \dot{m}_{ao} = -0.366 + 0.08979\cdot N\cdot P_m - 0.0337\cdot N\cdot P^2_m
% + 0.0001\cdot N^2 \cdot P_m
% $$
%
% $$ N \rightarrow \mbox{engine angular speed (rad/s); } $$
%
% $$ P_m \rightarrow \mbox{manifold pressure (bar); } $$
% 

%%
%
% To determine the total air charge pumped into the cylinders, the
% simulation integrates the mass flow rate from the intake manifold and
% samples it at the end of each intake stroke event. This determines the
% total air mass that is present in each cylinder after the intake stroke
% and before compression.

%% Compression Stroke
%
% In an inline four-cylinder four-stroke engine, 180 degrees of crankshaft
% revolution separate the ignition of each successive cylinder. This
% results in each cylinder firing on every other crank revolution. In this
% model, the intake, compression, combustion, and exhaust strokes occur
% simultaneously (at any given time, one cylinder is in each phase). To
% account for compression, the combustion of each intake charge is delayed
% by 180 degrees of crank rotation from the end of the intake stroke. 

%% Torque Generation and Acceleration
%
% The final element of the simulation describes the torque developed by the
% engine. An empirical relationship dependent upon the mass of the air
% charge, the air/fuel mixture ratio, the spark advance, and the engine
% speed is used for the torque computation (see Equation 4). 

%% 
% *Equation 4*
%
% $$ 
% Torque_{eng} = -181.3 + 379.36\cdot m_a + 21.91\cdot \left( \frac{A}{F} \right) -
% 0.85 \cdot \left( \frac{A}{F} \right)^2 + 0.26\cdot \sigma - 0.0028\cdot \sigma^2 +
% $$
%
% $$
% + 0.027 \cdot N - 0.000107 \cdot N^2 + 0.00048 \cdot N \cdot \sigma + 
% 2.55 \cdot \sigma \cdot m_a - 0.05 \cdot \sigma ^2 \cdot m_a
% $$
%
% $$ m_a \rightarrow \mbox{mass of air in cylinder for combustion (g); } $$
%
% $$ \left( \frac{A}{F} \right) \rightarrow \mbox{air to fuel ratio; } $$
%
% $$ 
% \sigma \rightarrow \mbox{spark advance (degrees before top - dead - center); }
% $$
%
% $$ Torque_{eng} \rightarrow \mbox{torque produced by the engine (Nm); } $$
%

%%
% 
% Calculate the engine angular acceleration using Equation 5

%% 
% *Equation 5*
%
% $$ J \dot{N} = Torque_{eng} - Torque_{load}$$
%
% $$ J \rightarrow \mbox{engine rotational moment of inertia } (kg\cdot m^2) \mbox{; }$$
%
% $$ \dot{N} \rightarrow \mbox{engine angular acceleration } (rad/s^2) \mbox{; }$$

%% Open-Loop Model 
%
% We incorporated the model elements described above into an engine model
% using Simulink. The following sections describe the decisions we made for
% this implementation and the key Simulink elements  used. This section
% shows how to implement a complex nonlinear engine model easily and
% quickly in Simulink environment. We developed this model in conjunction
% with Ken Butts, Ford Motor Company(R) (2).
%
% Figure 1 shows the top level of the model. Note that, in general, the
% major blocks correspond to the high-level list of functions given in the
% model description in the preceding summary. Taking advantage of
% Simulink's hierarchical modeling capabilities, most of the blocks in
% Figure 1 are made up of smaller blocks. The following paragraphs describe
% these smaller blocks.

% In the model, double click on the 'Throttle & Intake Manifold' subsystem
% to open it. It contains two other subsystems - the 'Throttle' and the
% 'Intake Manifold' subsystems. Open the 'Throttle' and 'Intake Manifold'
% to see their components.

%%
% *Figure 2:* The 'Throttle' and 'Intake Manifold' subsystems

%%
%
% Simulink models for the throttle and intake manifold subsystems are shown
% in Figure 2. The throttle valve behaves in a nonlinear manner and is
% modeled as a subsystem with three inputs. Simulink implements the
% individual equations, given in Equation 1, as function blocks. These
% provide a convenient way to describe a nonlinear equation of several
% variables. A 'Switch' block determines whether the flow is sonic by
% comparing the pressure ratio to its switch threshold, which is set at one
% half (Equation 1). In the sonic regime, the flow rate is a function of
% the throttle position only. The direction of flow is from the higher to
% lower pressure, as determined by the Sign block. With this in mind, the
% 'Min' block ensures that the pressure ratio is always unity or less.
%
% The differential equation from Equation 2 models the intake manifold
% pressure. A Simulink function block computes the mass flow rate into the
% cylinder, a function of manifold pressure and engine speed (see Equation
% 3).



%% Intake and Compression
%
% An integrator accumulates the cylinder mass air flow in the 'Intake'
% block (located inside the 'Throttle & Manifold' subsystem).  The 'Valve
% Timing' block issues pulses that correspond to specific rotational
% positions in order to manage the intake and compression timing. Valve
% events occur each cam rotation, or every 180 degrees of crankshaft
% rotation. Each event triggers a single execution of the 'Compression'
% subsystem. The output of the trigger block within the 'Compression'
% subsystem then feeds back to reset the Intake integrator. In this way,
% although both triggers conceptually occur at the same instant in time,
% the integrator output is processed by the 'Compression' block immediately
% prior to being reset. Functionally, the 'Compression' subsystem uses a
% 'Unit Delay' block to insert 180 degrees (one event period) of delay
% between the intake and combustion of each air charge.
%
% Consider a complete four-stroke cycle for one cylinder. During the intake
% stroke, the 'Intake' block integrates the mass flow rate from the
% manifold. After 180 degrees of crank rotation, the intake valve closes
% and the 'Unit Delay' block in the 'Compression' subsystem samples the
% integrator state. This value, the accumulated mass charge, is available
% at the output of the 'Compression' subsystem 180 degrees later for use in
% combustion. During the combustion stroke, the crank accelerates due to
% the generated torque. The final 180 degrees, the exhaust stroke, ends
% with a reset of the Intake integrator, prepared for the next complete 720
% degrees cycle of this particular cylinder.
%
% For four cylinders, we could use four 'Intake' blocks, four 'Compression'
% subsystems, etc., but each would be idle 75% of the time. We've made the
% implementation more efficient by performing the tasks of all four
% cylinders with one set of blocks. This is possible because, at the level
% of detail we've modeled, each function applies to only one cylinder at a
% time.

%% Combustion
%
% Engine torque is a function of four variables. The model uses a 'Mux'
% block to combine these variables into a vector that provides input to the
% 'Torque Gen' block. A function block computes the engine torque
% (described empirically in Equation 4). The torque which loads the engine,
% computed by step functions in the Drag Torque block, is subtracted in the
% Engine Dynamics subsystem. The difference divided by the inertia yields
% the acceleration, which is integrated to arrive at the engine crankshaft
% speed.

%% Plotting Simulation Results
%
% We used the following default inputs for the simulation:

%%
% $$Throttle  = 8.97\mbox{ (deg) if } t < 5 $$
%
% $$Throttle  = 11.93\mbox{ (deg) if } t \ge 5 $$
% 
% $$Load  = 25 \mbox{ (Nm) if } t \le 2 \mbox{ or } t\ge 8 $$
% 
% $$Load  = 20 \mbox{ (Nm) if } 2 < t \le 8 $$
%
% Try adjusting the throttle to compensate for the load torque. Figure 3 shows
% the simulated engine speed, the throttle commands which drive the simulation,
% and the load torque which disturbs it.

%% Conclusions 
%
% The ability to model nonlinear, complex systems, such as the engine model
% described here, is one of Simulink's key features. The power of the
% simulation is evident in the presentation of the models above. Simulink
% retains model fidelity, including precisely timed cylinder intake events,
% which is critical in creating a model of this type. The basic engine
% model shows the flexibility of Simulink.
